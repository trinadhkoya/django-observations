I am clear about my idea,
What tech Stack should we need to follow
and what would be deployment Server and etc

As we know,How Secure AWS was.I preferred this thing 
so gone through some docs
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/concepts.platforms.html#concepts.platforms.python

it currently supports
Python 3.4 version 2.3.1
pip 7.1.2
setuptools 18.4
meld3 1.0.2
Apache 2.4.18 with mod_wsgi 3.5

so keeping all those in mind,i want to develop my application with the above requirements,though we have upgrades available for every requriments
